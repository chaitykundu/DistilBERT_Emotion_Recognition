There is nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee. Really? I am opposite. I love sleeping in. I am most alert in the evenings. I'm a real night owl.

            " Hi everyone, Kevin here. Today we're going to look at how you can take speech and turn it into text using AI. And the really crazy thing is that it does a better job than most humans. You can use it with English and 96 other languages. It works even if you have a lot of background noise. And it's also the stuff if you have a very sick accent. The best part is that it's completely free and also open source. Let's check out how to do this. We're going to use an AI tool called Whisper. Whisper is made by a company called OpenAI. And you might have heard of them before. That's the same company behind the immensely popular chat GPT, which allows you to converse with a computer. There are also the company behind Dolly too, where you can type in some text, and then it'll generate an image based on that text.\n"

            " Hey! I heard that you're planning your friend's wedding party. How it going so far? It's quite exciting but also a bit overwhelming. There are so many things to consider and organize. I can imagine. Where are you thinking of hosting the party? They have decided to have it in a beautiful garden venue. Near their hometown. It's a lovely outdoor setting perfect for a romantic wedding. That sounds wonderful. You started working on the guest list. Yes. We have started compiling a list based on their preferences and budget. It is a tough task. You know. I understand. What about the wedding planner? Since the couple has a tight budget, they have decided to plan everything themselves. That's impressive. It will definitely save them some money. What about the decorations and theme? They are leaning towards a rustic theme with lots of greenery and natural elements. That sounds lovely and will create a cozy atmosphere. What about the menu? Have you discussed it with the couple? They want to have a diverse menu that caters to different dietary preferences. We are currently exploring different catering options. And doing tastings to ensure everything is delicious. Also, we are thinking of having a live band for reception. To make wedding party even more memorable and enjoyable. That's a fantastic idea. Do you need my assistance with anything? Thank you for offering. We might need some help with crafting the wedding invitations. I will let you know when we reach that stage. Consider it done. I will be there to listen and support you throughout the entire process. Thank you so much. Your support means a lot to me and the couple. I am confident that it's going to be a beautiful AMD memorable celebration.\n"
